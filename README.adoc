// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

You'll explore how to use Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) to drive your
RESTful web service on Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use hypermedia to create a specific style of a response JSON, which has contents
that you can use to navigate your REST service. You'll build on top of a simple inventory
REST service that you can develop with MicroProfile technologies. You can find the service at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
```

The service responds with a JSON file that contains an array of registered hosts. Each host has a collection
of HATEOAS links:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "hostname": "foo",
    "_links": [
      {
        "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/foo",
        "rel": "self"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "hostname": "bar",
    "_links": [
      {
        "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/bar",
        "rel": "self"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
  "hostname": "*",
  "_links": [
    {
      "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/*",
      "rel": "self"
    }
  ]
  }
]
----

=== What is HATEOAS?

HATEOAS is a constrained form of REST application architecture.
With HATEOAS, the client receives information about the available resources from the REST application.
The client does not need to be hardcoded to a fixed set of resources, and the application
and client can evolve independently. In other words, the application tells the client where it can go
and what it can access by providing it with a simple collection of links to other available resources.

=== Response JSON

When you build a RESTful web service, consider the style of your response files.
Whether they are JSON files, XML files, or in some other format, a good practice is to always have them in
a clean and organized form. In the context of HATEOAS, each resource must contain a link reference to
itself, commonly referred to as `self`. Each link also needs a relationship to be associated with it,
although no strict rules exist as to how you need to format this relationship. Contain the collection
of such links within a `_links` array, which itself must be a direct property of the
resource object. The underscore in the `_links` property is used so that the property does not collide with any
existing fields that are named `links`. In this guide, you will use the following structure of HATEOAS links:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  "_links": [
    {
      "href": ,
      "rel":
    }
  ]
----

==== Link types

The following example shows two different links. The first link has a `self` relationship with the
resource object and is generated whenever you register a host. The link points to that host
entry in the inventory:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  {
    "href": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>",
    "rel": "self"
  }
----

The second link has a `properties` relationship with the resource object and is generated
if the host `system` service is running. The link points to the properties resource on the host:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  {
    "href": "http://<hostname>:9080/system/properties",
    "rel": "properties"
  }
----

==== Other formats

Although you should stick to the previous format for the purpose of this guide, another common
convention has the link as the value of the relationship:

[source, json, role="no_copy"]
----
  "_links": {
      "self": "http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>",
      "properties": "http://<hostname>:9080/system/properties"
  }

== Creating the response JSON

Begin by building your response JSON, which is composed of the `_links` array, as well as the name of
the host machine.

=== Linking to inventory contents
InventoryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=!comment]
----

InventoryManager.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=!comment]
----

As mentioned before, your starting point is an existing simple inventory REST service. You can learn
more about this service and how to build it by visiting https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-intro.html[Creating a MicroProfile application^].

The request handlers in the [hotspot=17-38 file=0]`InventoryResource` class. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `InventoryResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java`
----

Since the `.../inventory/hosts/`
URL will no longer respond with a JSON representation of the contents of your inventory, you can discard the [hotspot=28-30 file=2]`listContents`
method and integrate it into the [hotspot=34-36 file=0]`getPropertiesForHost` method.


The contents of your inventory are now under the asterisk (*) wildcard and reside at the following URL:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/*
----

The [hotspot=27-29 file=0]`GET` request handler is responsible for handling all [hotspot=27-29 file=0]`GET` requests that are
made to the target URL. This method responds with a JSON that contains HATEOAS links.

The [hotspot=23 file=0]`UriInfo` object is what is used to build your HATEOAS links.

The [hotspot=22 file=0]`@Context` annotation is a part of CDI and indicates that the UriInfo will be injected when the
resource is instantiated.

Your new [hotspot=17-38 file=0]`InventoryResource` class is now finished. Next, let's implement the [hotspot=52-64 file=1]`getSystems` method and build
the response JSON object.

=== Linking to each available resource
InventoryManager.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=!comment]
----

InventoryUtil.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util/InventoryUtil.java[tags=!comment]
----
Take a look at your  [hotspot file=0]`InventoryManager` and [hotspot file=1]`InventoryUtil` files.

The [hotspot=52-64 file=0]`getSystems` method accepts a
target URL as an argument and returns a JSON object that contains HATEOAS links.

The [hotspot=30-35 file=1]`buildHostJson` helper method builds the actual JSON object. Use this method together with a
simple map function to create an array of the JSON objects for each system.

The [hotspot=30-35 file=1]`buildHostJson` helper in the `InventoryUtil` class creates a JSON object that contains the name of your host system and the [hotspot=39 file=1]`_links` array, which
is generated separately in another helper.

This helper accepts a hostname and a target URL as arguments. The helper builds a link that points to the
inventory entry with a `self` relationship and also builds a link that points to the `system` service with
a `properties` relationship:

* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>
* http://<hostname>:9080/system/properties

=== Linking to inactive services or unavailable resources
InventoryUtil.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util/InventoryUtil.java[tags=!comment]
----

Consider what happens when one of the return links does not work or when a link should be available
for one object but not for another. In other words, it is important that a resource or service is
available and running before it is linked in the [hotspot=39]`_links` array.

Although this guide does not cover this case, always make sure that you receive
a good response code from a service before you link that service. Similarly, make sure that
it makes sense for a particular object to access a resource it is linked to. For instance, it doesn't
make sense for an account holder to be able to withdraw money from their account when their balance is 0.
Hence, the account holder should not be linked to a resource that provides money withdrawal.

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the application
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the application

To see the new application in action, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` command from the `start` directory:

[role=command]
----
cd start
mvn liberty:start-server
----

After the server runs, you can find your new hypermedia-driven `inventory` service at the following URL:

* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts^]


// =================================================================================================
// Testing
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the hypermedia-driven RESTful web service

At the following URLs, access the `inventory` service that is now driven by hypermedia:

* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts^]
* http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/{hostname}[http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/{hostname}^]

The first URL returns the current contents of the inventory, and the second URL returns the system properties for
the host name. If the inventory does not contain an entry for the host name that is specified in the URL,
the `system` service that is running on the requested host name is called instead. The system
properties are retrieved from that `system` service and then stored in the inventory and returned.

If the servers are running, you can point your browser to each of the previous URLs to test the
application manually. Nevertheless, you should rely on automated tests since they are more reliable
and trigger a failure if a change introduces a defect.

=== Setting up your tests

EndpointTest.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/hateoas/EndpointTest.java[tags=!comment]
----

[role="code_command hotspot" subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `EndpointTest` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/hateoas/EndpointTest.java`
----

You can use the [hotspot=25]`@Before` and [hotspot=34]`@After` annotations to perform any setup and teardown tasks for each
of your individual tests.

=== Writing the tests

Each test method must be marked with the [hotspot=39]`@Test` annotation. Typically, the execution order of test
methods is not controlled, but if control is required, you can place methods in a single container test
method. This container method is then the only one marked with the [hotspot=39]`@Test` annotation. The following
[hotspot=40-43]`testSuite()` contains two test methods, which run in the order they appear:

The test [hotspot=48-68]`testLinkForInventoryContents` is responsible for asserting that
the correct HATEOAS link is created for the inventory contents.


The [hotspot=110-112]`getResponse` helper method reuses the same line of code for retrieving a response from a
specific URL. This technique helps keep your code neat and organized.

The [hotspot=117-119]`assertResponse` method ensures that the response code that you receive is
valid (200).

The [hotspot=74-105]`testLinksForSystem` test is responsible for asserting that the correct
HATEOAS links are created for the `localhost` system. This method checks for both the `self` link that points
to the `inventory` service and the `properties` link that points to the `system` service that is running on the
`localhost` system.

Finally, the method [hotspot=124-133]`visitLocalhost` creates a [hotspot=132]`GET` request to the
`system` service, registering the `localhost` system.

=== Running the tests

To rebuild and run the tests, navigate to the `start` directory and run the `mvn clean install` command
from the command line.

If the server is still running from previous steps, stop it first with the following commands:
[role=command]
----
mvn clean install liberty:stop-server
----

Some time might elapse before the tests finish running. If the tests pass, you will see the following
output:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
